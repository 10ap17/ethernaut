Ethernaut is a popular Ethereum smart contract security platform developed by OpenZeppelin. It provides a series of challenges designed to challenge participants to exploit various vulnerabilities and use security best practices in smart contracts.

The challenges in Ethernaut cover a wide range of topics, including reentrancy, access control, integer overflow/underflow, denial of service, and more. Each challenge presents a vulnerable smart contract, and the goal is to exploit the vulnerability to progress to the next level.

Ethernaut is widely used by developers, security auditors, and enthusiasts to gain hands-on experience in smart contract security.Completing Ethernaut challenges is an excellent way to deepen your understanding of Ethereum smart contract development and security.
